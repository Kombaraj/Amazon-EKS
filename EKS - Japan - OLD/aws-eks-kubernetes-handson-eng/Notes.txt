I am thinking to form a small pool of team to have knowledge sharing of cutting edge technologies like Containers, Kubernetes, Service Mesh. We will try to share the knowledge weâ€™ve gained from various sources. Itâ€™s 100% optional to participate ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜Š These sessions would be much helpful if someone is planning to get certified on CNCF CKA or to gain working knowledge on Kubernetes. Thinking to have these sessions in the weekends.

Let me know your participation.

Some topics in mind as of now are:

Containers basics
Kubernetes basics
Install and configure Kubernetes Cluster on laptop
AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) â€“ Installation & Configuration
Helm basics
Kubernetes dashboard
Deploy containerised applications into EKS
Ingress Controllers 
Authentication & Authorisation
Serverless Kubernetes with Fargate
Cluster Auto scalar
Horizontal Pod Auto scaler
Advanced Kubernetes Securities
Service Mesh (Primarily Istio)
